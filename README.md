**Overview** 

The code in this repo is designed to identify any given sentence's type (simple, complex, compound). 

Note: This program is made to be a simple framework and will not always be 100% right. For more heavy-duty use cases, you may want to use NLP models instead. 

Disclaimer: I may have used AI tools to help me bring this project to fruition.
